This small tool was built to easily convey the different types of envelopes: percussive, flat tones, and reverse percussive.

Natural sounds are characterized by an abrupt onset followed by an immediate exponential decay. These types of sounds are heard everyday, both in music and physical interactions. However unnatural flat tones are often used in electronic tools like medical equipment and psychological experiments. One of the projects in the Maple lab focuses on how the Amplitude Envelope may influence perception and memory associations.
